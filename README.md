I asked chatgpt "How do I add my email as a HTML link in my code for a website about myself
Chat gpt came back with "To add your email as a clickable HTML link on your website (so users can click it and open their email client), use the mailto: link format in an <a> (anchor) tag." and the example "<a href="mailto:yourname@example.com">yourname@example.com</a>" which I did use in my code.
I also asked Chatgpt "how to add an outside link for a website to my code," to which chatgpt replied "To add a link to an external website in your HTML code, use the <a> tag with the href attribute," and gave the example "<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>" that I used in my code.
